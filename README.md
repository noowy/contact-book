# contact-book
Contact book based on hashtable data structure (UNI project)
Console application

To use the contact book you must create a txt file and fill it with contacts (if you have any).
The format in which the enrties are kept is this:

Phone number (+X (XXX) XXX-XX-XX)  
Contact's name  
Contact's address  
Contact's email  

Entries are divided by newlines (one after another, don't need to make an additional one to separate them).

Application allows to add new subscribers, print the contact book to console, find subscriber by any field (fast search for phone number), delete subscribers and unload the phonebook to txt file (It was requested by the teacher, so I had to add it even though all the changes are immediately saved to the source txt file)
